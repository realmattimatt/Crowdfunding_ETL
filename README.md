# Crowdfunding_ETL
# Project 2: ETL mini project
## About: 
### The Crowdfunding_ETL project aims to extract, transform, and load data from crowdfunding datasets into a structured database. This project will provide valuable insights into the crowdfunding landscape by analyzing various factors that influence funding success. It will be used to develope an (ERD) chart to visualize the data structure, ultimately, loading it into a PostgreSQL. 



### Dependancies to load:
    1. import pandas as pd
    2. import numpy as np
    3. pd.set_option('max_colwidth', 400) # Not necessary but suggested for ease of reading
    4. import re # To use regular expressions if needed
    5. from datetime import datetime as dt
    6. import json

#### How to run:
    1. Install dependancies
    2. CD to Crowdfunding_ETL/ETL_Mini_Project_MMatti.ipynb and open in Jupyter Notebook.
